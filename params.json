{"name":"docker-tikaserver","tagline":"Apache Tika Server as a Docker Image","body":"# docker-tikaserver\r\nThis repo contains the Dockerfile to create a docker image that contains the latest Ubuntu running the Apache Tika 1.8 Server on Port 9998 using Java 7.\r\n\r\nOut-of-the-box the container also includes dependencies for the GDAL and Tesseract OCR parsers.  To balance showing functionality versus the size of the image, this file currently installs the language packs for the following languages:\r\n* English\r\n* French\r\n* German\r\n* Italian\r\n* Spanish.\r\n\r\nTo install more languages simply update the apt-get command to include the package containing the language you required, or include your own custom packs using an ADD command.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nFirst you need to pull down the build from Dockerhub, which can be done by invoking:\r\n\r\n    docker pull logicalspark/docker-tikaserver\r\n\r\nThen to run the container, execute the following command:\r\n\r\n    docker run -d -p 9998:9998 logicalspark/docker-tikaserver\r\n\r\n## Building\r\n\r\nTo build the image from scratch, simply invoke:\r\n\r\n    docker build -t 'docker-tikaserver' github.com/LogicalSpark/docker-tikaserver\r\n   \r\nYou can then use the following command (using the name you allocated in the build command as part of -t option):\r\n\r\n    docker run -d -p 9998:9998 docker-tikaserver\r\n    \r\n## More\r\n\r\nFor more info on Apache Tika Server, go to the [Apache Tika Server documentation](http://wiki.apache.org/tika/TikaJAXRS).\r\n\r\n## Author\r\n\r\n  * David Meikle (<david@logicalspark.com>)\r\n\r\n## Licence\r\n\r\n   Copyright 2015 David Meikle\r\n\r\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n   limitations under the License.\r\n","google":"UA-40347187-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
